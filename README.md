# AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE

In this project we are going to creat a prototype  of self driving car.

An autonomous car prototype is a vehicle that can guide itself 
without any human input. This kind of vehicle uses advanced 
machine learning algorithms to achieve self navigation.


## Objectives


 1 : Lane detection.

 2 : Lane end detection.

 3 : Stop sign detection

 4 : Object detection.

 5 : Traffic light detection.

 6 : Indicator lights circuit implementation.
